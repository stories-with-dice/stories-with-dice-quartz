# OSR system

I've been toying with the thought of running a solo campaign in the old school / OSR fantasy genre. This has mainly arisen from coming across [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) and the recent release of [Dwarrowdeep](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/384269/Dwarrowdeep). Knave is the lightest yet complete OSR system I've seen. I like it a lot. I dig the flexibility in class based on what items you have. This feels like a true motivation to dig into dungeons and steal all the items I can. A perfect opportunity to play out all the great OSR modules I've been collecting. Dwarrowdeep is one such module.

For my solo game I'm considering a couple of adjustments though.

## Ability Checks 
- get +2 if virtue or background apply.
- -2 if vice would detract
- check DCs are generally 15+ for clean success; 12-14 for partial; 11- for GM move.

## Gear
Instead of tracking all utility items, I'll use the abstraction of the **Adventurer's Pack**, with Usage Die. It starts at d20, and descends across the dice chain: d20 -> d12 -> d10 etc. 
Every time you want to use an item like: lock picks, torch, camp gear etc. you roll that UD.
On a 1-2 decrease the UD by one step. When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 you're out of gear. 
Replenishing one level costs 200 cp. 
Takes up UD/4 rounded up slots.
**Includes** the usual items: traps, bedroll, rope, pots, crowbar, torch, lantern, saws, lockpicks, rations etc.

## Holy symbol for Cleric

I found this somewhere on reddit

> I have the holy symbol take up two slots because it does two things - turn the undead and gives some healing (which is pretty important in Knave even if it isn't much). You can only acquire a holy symbol at a temple and you're probably going to have to do something for the clerical order in order to get one. 
> Holy Symbol – Banish Undead + Heal
> Level# per day; force up to WIS number of HD of undead to make a MORALE check
> Banished undead LOSE d4 HP and attempt to leave the area for 1d4 rounds 
> Restore 1d4 HP to self/ other PC’s L times per day with successful WIS check 

## Spells
Spell lists from https://wrathofzombie.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/the-concise-spell-list-for-any-version-of-dd-or-osr/

## Solo
To make the character more robust, I take the following inspiration from Scarlet Heroes:
- multiply damage output from PCs to NPCs by 4
- divide damage taken by PCs by 4

This is for one PC. Since I will probably run two, I will adjust those numbers to 2.

### Fray dice
- Once per round.
- Fighters DMG to all under lvl in melee range (d8)
- Wizards DMG to one at any lvl any range (d4)

## Others

I'd plop PBTA moves as I see fit.
- For ex, I don't enjoy hexcrawling so I'd use **Undertake a journey** instead.

## Solo framework

I will use the One Page Solo Engine. It is implemented on [this website](https://tayruh.github.io/solo/solo-roleplaying-toolkit.html).

I add the quest tracker system from Ironsworn. For every quest I choose a difficulty, a number. The number represents the number of **relevant** scenes I need to finish with success. I will have to experiment with this number.

## Campaign ideas
- Carcosa, for a dark dying earth vibe
- Dolmenwood, as the set released on Patreon seems complete and aventure-ready
- Points of Light, by Goodman Games
- use WWN to build my own world as I go along
