I've been meaning to run a Cthulhu Eternal solo game for some time. It's as a mean of playtesting my own material, scratch the itch of horror investigative games (I don't play enough ðŸ˜”), and test out all the adventures I've been collecting.

I'm going to be using:

- [Mythic GM 2E](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/422929/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator-Second-Edition)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Obsidian Inline Scripts](https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-inline-scripts)
- [Cthulhu Eternal](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/384110/Cthulhu-Eternal--Modern-Age-SRD)

I will also be putting roll results within

> ...comments, like this one. 

# Character Creation

Let's create our character first. Rolling on some tables I get 

> **Heather Gruger**

Rolling for character attributes, out of which I'll create a full character afterwards.

Is she a criminal? 

> Fate check (very likely):
EXTREME YES

She is a dedicated criminal.

Does she have another job, or a cover?

> Meaning (description):
NICELY FAMILIAR

I think she runs a local business or shop. 

> Meaning (description):
> ODDLY HORRIBLE

She works as a nurse. She moonlights as a medic for criminals etc. 

Why? Or what is her motivation in the long-run? What's her aspiration?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters Motivations#^Mythic2CharactersMotivations]]: Strange

Heather is into the liminal and transgressive. I think she went to study medicine because her parents made her. Though in the beginning she didn't like it, she grew to enjoy it, because she got to experience humanity in very odd and vulnerable states: blood, wounds, death. This slowly grew into a morbid fascination. I can definitely see this character fitting into the DG/Cthulhu universe.

Some more details about her family and background.

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters Background#^Mythic2CharactersBackground]]: Art
> 

Her main Bond is an artist of sort. Let's leave that undefined for now.

What does she look like?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters Appearance#^Mythic2CharactersAppearance]]: Cool

She looks cool. Probably wears a leather jacket and has tattoos. 

Next I'll play out the first interaction she had with the unnatural and how she got recruited into the Organization. This will be a few scenes in the hospital she works at.

# Second Character

For the next character:

> Marcel Rothery

And a face

> [!info] Portrait of Marcel Rothery

What's his main *deal*?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters#^Mythic2Characters]]: Natural

This makes me think he's a forest ranger or some sort of outdoorsy type. Which is cool!

Is he in law enforcement?

> Fate check (very likely):
YES

So he's part of some Forest Protection agency. Need to research this more.

What's his second *deal*?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters#^Mythic2Characters]]: Official

Two ideas here. 1) He's some sort of local official (perhaps a lead in the forest protection agency) 2) Part of the Organization already.

> Is he a local official?
> Fate check (likely):
EXTREME YES

So that means he is or was a reputable local official. I'm going to say he used to be the town mayor some years ago. Due to job stress, he retired to being a forest ranger.

What's his motivation in life? What's his aspiration?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters Motivations#^Mythic2CharactersMotivations]]: Idea

He's into... philosophy?? Oh, I think he's a sort of "Walden" type. He retired to a life of peace and nature after a stressful term as mayor. That can also fit quite well into a Lovecraftian setting. Spooky forests with a pensive philosopher. I think Marcel was an idealist, which is what got him into politics. However, politics tend to crush that idealism. That's what happened to Marcel too. 

Who's main Bond?

> ðŸŽ² [[Characters#^Mythic2Characters]]: Powerful

It's the current mayor! Of course ðŸ˜† 

> What's their relationship?
> ðŸŽ² [[Characters#^Mythic2Characters]]: Defiant

They are former political enemies, but now they've grown closer. 

We'll play out his first meeting with the unnatural, most likely set in the forest.
