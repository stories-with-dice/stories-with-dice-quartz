Let's continue on from [[lone-scum/session 0|last time]]

I've updated the map with the ship position, better icons, and a legend. See [[lone-scum/session 0 - campaign overview|setting overview]].

Today I will focus on the specific settlement Neoma and its trouble. 

Following along from Starforged, pg. 116, we do the following:

# Settlement trouble

1. First look (1-2)

Hidden or subsurface location, Built from random scrap

> [!info]-
> This is already interesting to me. Paints a picture of *lived* space, but it's also decaying and frail. 
> 

Because the settlement was built out of scrap, it was built in a hurry and haphazardly. This could have lead to sections of the settlement to have been gradually abandoned or forgotten. 

2. Trouble

Invasive nature or life-form

I roll on Theme and Descriptor: 
- World
- Biological

People have been trying to investigate these abandoned part of the station in order to recover materials needed for maintenance and expansion. Some have come out... infected. Their skins have shown aggressive rashes. 

Since, there the station isn't tied to a planet, we skip the part about generating Planet-related information.

The initial situation will be placed on this station.

# Character creation

I will now create my character.

I will be rolling dice to make my choices.

> [!info]-
> Playbook: 1d7 (2) = `2`. Mechanic.
> Heritage: 1d4 (4) = `4`. Wanderer (I removed Xeno and Manufactured)
> Background: 1d7 (**7**) = `7` -- Syndicate. Part of a criminal gang, the [[lone-scum/session 0 - campaign overview#Broken Hounds|Broken Hounds]]
> Vice: 1d8 (5) = `5` -- Pleasure.

![Arthur|230](https://i.imgur.com/plnyUHT.jpg)

Arthur was part of many gangs before settling on Neoma. "Settling" might be the wrong word, though. He just "ended up" here. He wanted to get away from his previous life so took a job as a mechanic here two years ago. He's been one of the engineers keeping the place together. 

In his spare time, Arthur enjoys the fine arts, especially performative arts, like theatre or dance. It's mostly the local art troupe on the station he fancies. He's grown quite fond of Samantha, one of the actresses in the group. She's shown him a completely different side of life. Most of his life is about the cogs and terminals of the station; the shows he watches are about the body and the emotions people hide within. There's something similar between them, deep down: they are both complex systems that feel like _problems to solve_. This has helped Arthur come out of his shell and make more human connections.

## Ship

I will generate the ship when I get to it. Most likely this will be the reward of the first or second job.

Next session I will set up the trouble more and hopefully get the engagement roll

> The engagement roll is one of my fav parts of Blades in the Dark games
