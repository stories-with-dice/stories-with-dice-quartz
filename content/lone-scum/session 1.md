# Session 1

Arthur is in his own head, off work for this evening, sitting by himself in the bar of the station Neoma. 

"I sure could go with a beer", he thinks to himself. 

They had run out of luxury items for about half a year now. 

"Luxury item", Arthur laughs to himself.

He has a hard time grasping just how isolated the station -- and himself -- had become over the last months. It all started with the last shipment being delayed. And then they finally realized the shipment would be delayed _indefinitely_. No one had since travelled the lane to Pinnacle. They had managed to get in touch with the governor on the settlement there. 

"We know the last shipments haven't come through", he had said. "But there's nothing we can do right now. We can't prioritize putting more resources down your way. We are very sorry. We will do our outmost best to serve Neoma's people. Please bear with us."

Nothing happened. No shipments, no resources, nothing. The people on the stations had grown desperate. Arthur had noticed it. Things were breaking down and they were forced to cut off sections of the stations. He would then recycle the scrap as much as he could to fix the essentials. Even parts of the essential systems had been ignored. He hoped nothing would break them now. 

Governor Coolidge. He was quite the figure. Arthur knew had a hunch he was in cahoots with the criminal gang he had worked with. He was sabotaging the UN's -- and humanity's -- efforts at flourishing and reconnecting with the old colonies. The Great Project was a dream they all shared. But Coolidge thought he could get away with lining his pockets. Yet Arthur couldn't provide any proof. So when he was caught by the Broken Hounds digging through their databases, he had to ditch and run. And that's how he landed on Neoma. But one day he will take down that rat. 

> Gov Coolidge will become one of Arthur's enemies, on his sheet.

But suddenly something breaks Arthur out of his reveries.

> CF 4

An alarm is being sounded by the internal PA: "Warning, sleep sectors A and B are going into shutdown. Life support system offline. Please evacuate sleep sectors A and B."

Sleep sector B was Samantha's. He dashes out of the bar to the rec room, where the theatre group usually gathers. On the way there, he sees families forming lines out of the sectors A and B, with the few belongings they could carry. 

"Families from sleep sectors A and B will be redistributed among other sectors", the PA continued.

> There is a virus in the air that the air filtration system has detected. It then shut down as it couldn't identify it. The system crashed completely.

Arthur sees Samantha in the rec room. She's with the other artist friends. 

"Everything alright? I will investigate and try to fix the life support as soon as..", Arthur says.

> Samnatha: SEEKS TO END THE ENCOUNTER (2d10 (9, 3) + 2 = `14`)

Samantha seems absent. She's having a panic attack, Arthur realizes. 

"It's okay", he says. 

He hugs her and grabs a blanket from one of the couches in the room to wrap around her. 

"Here, lie down". 

She stretches out on the couch. 

"I'll go and check in on the systems right away. Just...". Arthur can't finish his sentence. He doesn't know how to finish his sentence. 

The life support systems were supposed to be state of the art. Could this be related to the rashes people have been experiencing when going through the offline sections? Maybe a hull breach and extreme temperatures could lead to skin sensitivity, he thought.
