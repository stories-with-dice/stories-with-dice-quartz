My goal last session was to restart the life support in the sections A & B. These had been disabled when the life support system had suddenly gone offline. But now I am fatigued and exhausted from the lack of oxygen in there. My lungs are still burning from the exertion.

> Let's see what happens

I ask around the station about any information on the people that had been into Agriculture-2. This is the one that had been offline and from where people had just arrived after a scavenging trip.

> [!info]
> Roll: 3 [4, 6, 6, 6] + 3 = 6. Means extremely good success

I finally get the information that these people had noticed some weird things floating through the air. They had thought nothing of it, dismissing it as nothing but some scrap from the equipment.

I decide to raise this issue to the administrator of the station, Felix.

> [!info]
> 
SEEKS TO END THE ENCOUNTER (2d10 (3, 8) + 3 = `14`)

The administrator is initially dismissive of my alarm, saying I have no proof. I try to convince him to give some equipment and men to get into Ag-2 to get a sample.

> [!info]
> 4dF (5,6,4,5) +1 = `4`

He agrees to give some equipment.

I delve into section. But first I want to check in with Sam.

When I check with Samantha, I see someone is spying on me on her. They are trailing me through the station. I try to confront them.

> [!info]
> ACTS OUT OF PC INTEREST (2d10 (3, **1**) + 2 = `6`)
> Random descriptors: Majestically, Delightful

> They deny everything


I turn around and push the individual into a side room. "Who are you, what do you want?" I asks. They deny everything with an arrogant and dismissive tone. "Whatever do you mean?" They are an middle-aged man, with a smooth skin, like they are never exposed to the engines that power this station. I is careful to not blow this. "Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. Huh, the recent situation has gotten everyone on edge. I." and he extends his hand.

He tells me his name. Might be a fake one though. "Dominic Baptiste". I came here with the last shipment and got stuck here. No way for me to check this right now, but he does later.

> [!info]
> SEEKS TO END THE ENCOUNTER (2d10 (6, 4) + 4 = `14`)
> He tries to break the convo

"Ok, well, nice to meet you, I. I'm just checking out the station as a rep of UN logistics. I have to get back to work, seeing if there is a way to secure another transit line"

He moves away. 

I open my compad and checks the last ship to arrive. 

> [!info]
> Do I have access to that? Fate check: No (7+2+-1; C: 2 vs 5)

No access to the data. Weird, I think. I decide not to bring this to the admin again. Too much attention on me and I doesn't want to be a pain in his ass.

I descend into Ag-2, with a compressor suit. 

> [!info]
> Did the people tell me how the nanite swarms look like?
> Fate check: Yes (9+8+2; C: 5 vs 6)


I examine the place looking for anything odd matching the descriptions from the people that had been here earlier.

> [!info]
> 4dF (6,3,3,5) +2 = `4`


I see them. As I approach them, I take out my sampling kit ready. I reach out with my pipette to absorb some into a safe receptacle. Suddenly, an alarm goes off in the sector and the gate to the outside is lifting. 

> [!info]
> Baptiste is triggering these

I jump to grab the nearest bar to resist the pull of the escaping air pressure.

I pull himself along the side of the sector to the manual override of the airlock. He locks it.

I try to determine from the airlock system used here, where could somebody activate it. 

> [!info]
> 4dF (5,2,1,6) +3 = `3`
> I can't get the specific location, but it seems this model would allow remote commands from multiple places: the admin office, the sector admin office. 


I decide to check if someone is in the admin office of the section. I try to approach it in a silent, sneaky way.

> [!info]
> 4dF (2,5,5,3) +2 = `3`
> Partial. I think he locks the door to the room and prepares his gun

I approach the admin room and I see a light and some noises. I accidentally bump into something and cause some noise. The person inside seems to have noticed, as they close the door to the room and I hear them cock a gun. 

I have to quickly change sides in order to maintain surprise, and I decide to approach from above the room, and threaten from the window.

> [!info]
> 4dF (3,2,5,1) +1 = `0`
> failure. He sees me and shoots to break the glass


I jump to the side and circle around the office box. But Baptiste shoots and breaks the glass. 

"Stop right there, Arthur!"

I try to calm him down.

"This must be some misunderstanding. Why did you open the airlock in here? In fact, what are you doing in here?" 

> [!info]
> what does he do? TALKS, EXPOSITION (2d10 (8, 8) + 3 = `19`)


"No misunderstanding. This station now belongs to the Hounds!" 

He shoots again, widly, just to intimidate.

"The Hounds rule here and the pititful UN cannot even help you."

"OK, but why sabotage this sytem?"

> [!info]-
> 4dF (4,1,5,4) +1 = `1`
> use FP
> 4dF (2,2,1,4) +1 = `-2`


I fail miserably to convince him to talk.

"Ok, no more talking. You're pain in the ass!"

He aims and shoots straight at me.

> [!info]-
> 4dF (4,5,3,1) +2 = `2`
> defense: 4dF (1,5,4,1) +1 = `0`
> I fail and take 2 stress dmg

I jump out of the way but the bullet hits me in my shoulder. I scream but continue to run away.

> [!info]-
> 4dF (2,6,5,2) +1 = `1`

I hear bullets flying behind me as I dash across the zero G environment back to the airlock to the main section. I need to alert the admin. I hide behind some boxes and message Felix.

> [!info]-
> 4dF (2,3,6,5) +2 = `3`
> I succeed but Baptiste will find me soon

I open my compad and start a call to Felix. 

> [!info]-
> Does he answer? Fate check: Yes (1+6+6; C: 10 vs 1)

He answers but a loud, annoyed "Yes, Arthur?"

> [!info]-
> Does this attract Baptiste? Fate check: Yes (6+6+3; C: 9 vs 6)

I hear Baptiste approaching faster. 

I quickly blurt out "I'm in Ag-2 with some saboteur from the Broken Hounds. Send help!" 
I start running again as bullets fly past me.

> [!info]-
> 4dF (1,2,5,2) +1 = `-1`
> 4dF (3,2,5,5) +2 = `3`
> I take a moderate conseq -- "Bullet wounds in my legs"

I take a bullet in my left leg and I let out another scream. My leg is exploding with sharp pain. I grit my teeth as I struggle to keep my focus. I reach the door and open it up quickly.

> [!info]-
> Did help arrive? Fate check: Yes and random event - NPC action/Travel/Dispute (8+2+3; C: 5 vs 6)

There's someone at the airlock. It's Felix and he's bearing a rifle. Never thought I'd feel so relieved at this combination. I press the airlock to open.

"Where is he?", Felix asks.

I turn around and I see Baptiste is gone.

> [!info]-
> He escapes out through the Ag-2 airlock.

"Weasel, he's getting out through the airlock!"

"Quickly, I'll send out a shuttle to catch him", Felix says.

> [!info]-
> CF 5
> Chaos check: None

We get to the security section and we send out a security shuttle to scan the perimeter.

> [!info]-
> Does it catch him? Fate check: Yes (3+10+4; C: 2 vs 5)

During the interrogation, where Felix lets me watch, we get a transmissions from The Broken Hounds. They send a message to us that they can give us the cure to the virus if I agree to talk to them one on one.
