You have contacts that can help 
you to get vital gear very cheaply. Once a 
session, you can use this to obtain an 
item instead of taking resource stress or 
consequences. This is an overcome action 
opposed by the cost of the purchase. If you 
succeed at a cost, your contact may ask for 
a favor in return or might be less willing to 
help you in the future.
